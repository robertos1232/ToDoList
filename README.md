# ToDoList
This is a todo project in python for study. This app is simplicity and beauty

## Installation
Please use git clone to your favorit folder.

```bash
gh repo clone robertos1232/ToDoList
```
I personally run this application on ubuntu 22.04 with python 3.7.

Before running this app, you should install few pip modules

```bash
#pip requirements
pip3 install kivy kivymd sqlalchemy pytest fastapi
# also from apt please install xclip and sqlite3
sudo apt-get install xclip

```

After git clone please go to:
